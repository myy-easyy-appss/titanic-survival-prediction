# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This is a machine learning classification project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on attributes like age, gender, class, and more.

## 🔍 Features Used
- Pclass (Passenger class)
- Sex (Male/Female)
- Age
- SibSp (Siblings/Spouses aboard)
- Parch (Parents/Children aboard)
- Fare
- Embarked (Boarding port)

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 📈 Results
The model was trained using Logistic Regression and achieved good prediction accuracy. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Try Random Forest or XGBoost
